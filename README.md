# Motif-2.0

!!For some still unknown reason, the setup is not working propely, and the software loses access to the database!!

This was a project made for "PAP" (Prova de Aptidão profissional = Proof of Profissional Aptitude), that is required to do in the last year of Highschool(12º). 
I decided to make an invoicing program. I didn't make it so that its legit, but it can be used has a guide or just for information. 
  
You can't use this for "real" as it is not allowed by the goverment, only to yourself

## Files only available in the language - Portuguese

  - The file "APRESENTAÇÃO DA PAP - Motif 2.0" is a complement to the program presentation to the juris

  - The file "Relatório Final" is a final resume of the program explaining some things about it

##
```bash
The project is made on Visual Basic 2010 and the database is made on Microsoft Access 2007

It has more than 100 files, so i cannot publish it unless it is a compressed file.

You can just download and open it, you can then see all the files inside, plus you can also execute the program to try it out.
```
