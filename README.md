# Motif-2.0

!!For some still unknown reason, the setup is not working propely, and the software loses access to the database!!

This was a project made for "PAP" (Prova de Aptidão profissional = Proof of Profissional Aptitude), that is required to do in the last year of Highschool(12º). 
I decided to make an invoicing program. I didn't make it so it's legit, but it can be used has a guide or just for information. 
  
That being said, please don't use this for you own benefit, even if that could be possible, somehow.

## Files only available in the language - Portuguese

  - The file "APRESENTAÇÃO DA PAP - Motif 2.0" is a complement to the program presentation to the juris

  - The file "Relatório Final" is a final resume of the program explaining some things about it

##
```bash
The project is made on Visual Basic 2010 and the database is made on Microsoft Access 2007

It has more than 100 files, so i can't publish it unless it's a compressed file.

You can just download and open it, you can then see all the files inside, plus you can also execute the program to try it out.
